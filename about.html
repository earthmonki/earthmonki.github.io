        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Personal Life</h3>
	<p>Hello, my name is Preston Clark. I am currently 21 years old, and am a senior and an Information Technology major here at Kennesaw State University. I pride myself in school spirit, as I am a member of both the Marching Owls and the university's chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi. I am the middle child of my family with two brothers, ages 17 and 24. Outside of school, my hobbies include playing board and video games.</p>

	<h3>IT Background</h3>
	<p>Information technology has always been a fascination of mine, as I have been surrounded by it my whole life. My dad works in the IT field and from time to time invites me into his home office to show me what he's been working on. Being the only of his sons not into sports, we naturally bonded over computers and their software. In elementary school, I was a part of the tech club, where I built my first website, although only a drag-and-drop kind, as well as made simple projects in scratch.mit.edu. This was the spark that lit the fire in my heart, and from then, I made several more Scratch projects of increasing complexity and style. Come freshman year of high school, I took the Introduction to Digital Technology course, where I learned HTML, CSS, and a few other coding languages. These languages came very easy to me, and I greatly enjoyed making websites. While I didn't learn any 	other languages or coding strategies outside of school, I knew that I wanted to pursue this field in college and beyond.</p>
	<hr>
	<h3>College Experience</h3>
	<p>So far, Kennesaw State has strengthened my love for coding and development. During freshman year, I learned Java, Python, and SQL, and for the most part have come to love each one of them. Python has become my personal favorite, given the simplicity of the language and few rules when coding it. I hope that in the future I am able to work in a field that will adequately use my skills.</p>
